# APITestingWithPytest

This repository provides a framework for API testing using Python and Pytest. It includes test cases for validating API endpoints, checking response status codes, data formats, and content. The framework is structured for easy configuration, setup, and teardown of tests, with support for data-driven testing. Pytest plugins are used to enhance reporting and handle test configurations, making it suitable for automated API validation in CI/CD pipelines.
